Guidance for AI agents working on this project.

## Commands

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build, test, benchmark, profile, coverage, and lint commands.

Always use MCP resources for semantic analysis and exploration. For example, codegraph and gopls MCP servers are available.

## Gograph — Go Repository Intelligence

Rules (enforced when gograph MCP server is connected):

1. NEVER use grep, rg, find, or glob to search for Go symbols, functions, structs, or types. Use gograph_query instead.
2. Before editing any symbol, run gograph_plan with symbol and with_context=true — this returns the change plan AND full context for every inspect_first symbol in one call.
3. After editing Go code, run gograph_review with uncommitted=true to verify test coverage and blast radius.
4. To understand a symbol, use gograph_context — it returns node, source, callers, callees, tests, and an architectural role classification in one call. Use uncommitted=true to get context for all uncommitted symbols at once.
5. Run gograph_capabilities at the start of any Go coding session.
